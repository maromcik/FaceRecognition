# FaceRecognition
This project is client code to the [Face Recognition Server](https://github.com/maromcik/FaceRecognitionServer).

It detects faces in video streams from multiple cameras and sends detected and aligned faces to the server.

It is configured via configuration file located in the user's home directory. This file is generated by the server and sent over SSH to clients.
